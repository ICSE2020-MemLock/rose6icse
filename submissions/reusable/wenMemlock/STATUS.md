# Apply for the Reusable and Available Badges

We are applying the Reusable and Available badges for the following reason.
- we have made our prototype tool available via Github. We placed it on a publicly accessible archival repository.
- we carefully documented and well-structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing are facilitated. 
- we provide a shell script to automatically build the docker image and the running environment. 
- In particular, we also made our experimental benchmark available and provide some shell script to automatically build and perform fuzzing on the benchmark program.
