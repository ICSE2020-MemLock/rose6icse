We apply for the Reusable badge. 

For the functionality of this artifact, we provide packages and detailed instructions to support repeatability of all the experiments of our companion paper, which enables users to reproduce the results for all the four research questions addressed across the companion paper.

Moreover, the artifact also facilitates the reuse and repurposing of our proposed data-constraint analysis framework from the following perspective:

* The data-constraint analysis tools can be reused with detailed instructions which can be found in both the installation file, on the public [github page](https://hyperloop-rails.github.io/vibranium/docs/docker). Also, the source code of the tools are provided inside the docker and in [github repository](https://github.com/manageconstraints/data-constraint-checker), which enables the repurposing. 

* The issues collected from the bug tracking systems of the 12 open source applications are available through the [link](http://bit.ly/data-constraints-issues-in-Rails), which can be used to repurpose the study in Section 6. 

* The user study result can be reused with the de-identified raw data as well as the detailed steps to summarize the raw results provided by the [link](http://bit.ly/error-message-user-study). Also, the corresponding [questionnaire](http://bit.ly/user-questionnaire) can be used to repurpose the user study.
