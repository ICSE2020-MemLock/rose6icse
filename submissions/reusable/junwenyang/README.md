The artifact has been published as a docker image on Docker Hub with the [link](http://bit.ly/docker-image-278).  

This artifact for our companion paper “Managing data constraints in database-backed web applications (#278)” includes the data-constraint analysis tools we developed and raw data produced by our user study. 
We hope this artifact can demonstrate the use of our data-constraint analysis tools to reviewers and potential users.


## What's inside the artifact:

Inside the artifact, you can find the following items:

1. The source code of our data-constraint analysis tools, including different parameters to analyze different aspects of constraints:

   * --lastest, extract all constraints in the latest version of the applications
   * --tva, analyze the evolution of constraints change
   * --single, compare the constraints across layer 
  
2. Benchmarks used in our paper to evaluate our data-constraint analysis tools, including

   * The source code of 12 open-source Ruby-on-Rails applications that we evaluate Panorama upon, under `main278/formatchecker/apps/`
  
   * The 114 issues collected from the bug tracking system of the 12 applications.

3. The [questionnaires](http://bit.ly/user-questionnaire) and [results of our user study](http://bit.ly/error-message-user-study) is located at `/home/main278/user-study`.

## What to do with the artifact and how?

With the code and data included in the docker image, one can use the tool to manage data constraints, directly and also reproduce the experiments in our paper. 

We put detailed instruction of both in the [INSTALL](https://github.com/manageconstraints/rose6icse/blob/master/submissions/available/junwenyang/README.md) file.
