We are applying for the functional/reusable/available badges.

The artifact is available as we have provided a replication package containing the code of the artifact, which will be put in an archival repository after AE. The artifact is functional; we have included the original code used to run the experiments in the paper, and this code can be built and run on the provided benchmarks. 

We believe the artifact is reusable as we have provided an extensive README detailing how to (1) replicate the plots shown in the paper from the pre-existing data, and (2) how to re-run the experiments from the paper on a different machine, and use the same plotting scripts to validate that the results are close enough (i.e., within variation due to machine specs/randomness) to those presented in the paper.
