# CodeSynthViewer -- Badge(s) Description

We are applying for both the available badges.

An available badge is awarded for an artifact that is functional, carefully documented/structured to the extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated, and placed on a publicly accessible archival repository. We assert that our software meets all three such criteria. Firstly, our software is functional -- it was used in our experiment, and functions as described in both our paper as well as on the public Github repository (link provided). Secondly, the code is both documented for comprehension, and structured in such a way that it can be easily understood AND configured for future human studies. Regarding configurability, the README of the public repository contains explicit instructions for how to repurpose our software for future studies. Lastly, we have placed our software on Github -- a publicly accessible archival repository. Thus, we also fulfill the criteria for an available badge.
